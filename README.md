## Competition objective
Classify tweets for hate/violent sentiments in them
## Personal objective
I started this project with the objective of leveraging on the power of 
- word embeddings(used GLoVe)
- Sequential architechture DL model (LSTM)
I had kept the text processing to bare minimum and relied heavily on the Language model and DL architecture

This solution got me to under 200 rank on the leaderboard for the below analytics vidhya competition
